# YWYM-001: Introduction to Data Analysis with Python
For High School Students and Freshmen in colleage

## Introduction 
Welcome to "Introduction to Data Analysis with Python"!
In today's data-driven world, the ability to analyze and interpret information is becoming increasingly valuable. This course is designed specifically for **high school students/freshmen in college who are curious about data analysis but have no prior coding experience**. Our goal is to guide you through your first steps into the exciting world of data science and programming.
Throughout this course, you'll learn:

- Basic computer operations using the command-line interface (CLI) on Linux or macOS systems
- Fundamental concepts of Python (one of the most popular programming language)
- Essential statistical ideas for data analysis
- Simple yet powerful models like linear regression
- Introduction to machine learning with basic models such as Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs)

To enhance your learning experience, we've included:

- Online Labs: Interactive environments where you can practice coding and data analysis in real-time
- Public Datasets: Real-world data for you to explore and analyze

These hands-on components will allow you to apply what you've learned immediately, reinforcing your understanding and building practical skills.
